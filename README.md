kanji-decomposition
===================

Decompose one kanji (hanji, Hán tự, Hanza etc...) into components (parts), database based on RADKFILE project

### The inception
As the burden of Japanese learning, I need a way to browse Kanji around by breaking a (known) kanji into 
pieces, use that piece to browse other kanji, that's what I wanted. On windows platform the zkanji project 
does that quite well but on android I hardly found one, most of them support searching kanji from there known 
part (you know what part (部首etc..) that kanji have and use that to search), but sometimes that may get into 
stuck that with some kanji you don't know well all the parts or with your known parts the result are plenty 
that you hardly find your desired one. 
So I decided to make the one that I need on my own, with the help of the [RADKFILE/KRADFILE]
(http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kradinf.html) project.

### Future plans/TODO
* Using wikicommon database for more updated kanji information:

* There's an awesome project writen in python, should us use their databases?
