<b>Introduction</b>
</p>
<p>
This project provides a decomposition of kanji into a number of visual elements or radicals
to support software which provides a lookup service using kanji components.
</p>
<p>
The initial files were based on work done in 1994/1995 by Michael Raine in which he
analyzed all the JIS208 kanji and identified the constituent radicals and 
other common elements, with the intention of facilitating the selection of
kanji within a dictionary program (JWP) by identifying multiple elements.
The file was coverted into a pair of text files and revised by Jim Breen in 
September 1995. Many further revisions have been made over the years.
</p>
<p>
<b>The KRADFILE file</b>
</p>
<p>
This is the basic file of data.
The file consists of 6,355 lines of text; one for each of the 
JIS X 0208-1997 kanji. Each line is a follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the kanji itself,
</li>
<li>a space followed by a colon (:) followed by a space,
</li>
<li>one or more radicals/elements which can be seen in the kanji. These
are drawn from JIS X 0208-1997. Where the element alone is not in
JIS X 0208, a kanji which contains the element is used instead.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following table (from the WWWJDIC server) shows the radicals/elements
used in the decomposition. Note that they are NOT the same as the
classical 214 radicals, although there is considerable overlap.

<p></p>
<p>
The decomposition is based on what can be seen in typical kanji
glyphs. Elements themselves can be further subdivided. For example,
Àå is an element and so is ¸ý, so the elements in ÏÃ are &lt;¸ý Àå ¸À&gt;.
</p>
<p>
Here is a short sample of the file:
</p>
<pre>°¥ : °á ¸ý Ðµ
°¦ : ¿´ ÄÞ ÑÌ Ôé
</pre>
<p>
<b>The RADKFILE file</b>
</p>
<p>
The RADKFILE file is an inversion of the KRADFILE file, and is the file used
by kanji lookup software. The format is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>all lines starting with a  identify a kanji element, followed by its
stroke-count and optionally either the JIS X 0212 code of the kanji 
whose glyph better depicts the element in question or the name of an image
file (used by the WWWJDIC server).
</li>
<li>all other lines with kanji in them are associated with the previously
identified element.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, the following lines identify the kanji containg the »Ò
component:
</p>
<p>
 »Ò 3
<br>
³Ç³Ô³Øµ¨µý¶µ¸É¸Ö¸ü¹¥¹¦¹§¹Ú»Æ»Ò»Ú»ú½Î½Ï½ß½æ½øÂ¸Â¹Â½Æ×ÆØÆýÉâËÖÌÒÌÔÍ·ÍûÐÚÒã

</p>
<p>
<b>RADKFILE2/KRADFILE2</b>
</p>
<p>
This pair of files cover the additional 5,801 kanji in the JIS X 0212
set. They were prepared by Jim Rose in 2007. They are in the same format
as RADKFILE/KRADFILE.
</p>
<p>
<b>Software</b>
</p>
<p>
Some of the software that uses the files are:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>the JWP and JWPce WP/dictionary programs (Windows)
</li>
<li>my
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/xjdic/">xjdic </a>
Unix/Linux/X11 dictionary program
</li>
<li>Botond Botyanszki's
 <a href="http://gjiten.sourceforge.net/">GJITEN </a>
Unix/Linux dictionary program
</li>
<li>the
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1R">WWWJDIC server. </a>
WWWJDIC uses a combination of the two files, enabling the technique to be
used for the 12,156 kanji in JIS X 0208 and 0212.
